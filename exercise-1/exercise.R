### Exercise 1 ###

# Load the httr and jsonlite libraries for accessing data
install.packages("httr")
library("httr")
library("jsonlite")

## For these questions, look at the API documentation to identify the appropriate endpoint and information.
## Then send GET() request to fetch the data, then extract the answer to the question

# How many forks does the most popular repository (by number of forks) have when you search for the term "d3"?
# (search for the term, and sort descending by the number of forks)
base.uri <- "https://api.github.com"
resource <- "/search/repositories"
url.full <- paste0(base.uri, resource)
query.params <- list(q = "d3", sort = "forks", order = "desc")
response <- GET(url.full, query = query.params)
response.content <- content(response, "text")
body.data <- fromJSON(response.content)
most.popular.forks <- body.data$items[1,"forks"]
# How many public repositories does our course organization have?
